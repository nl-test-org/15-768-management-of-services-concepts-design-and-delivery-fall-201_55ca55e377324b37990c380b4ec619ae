Case Overview
-------------

There are approximately 20 cases in this course. Each person should write up three of these during the term. A write-up is a three-page analysis of the case, guided by the discussion questions, any readings for the session, and any ideas discussed previously in the course.

Write-up Guidelines
-------------------

Assume you are writing to someone (e.g., a senior person with responsibility in the organization) who knows the facts; keep it succinct; many senior executives don't want to read long reports. The write-up is not to exceed three single-spaced pages of typed text (not smaller than 12 pt. font, please), with up to three supporting exhibits.

A good paper should clearly and succinctly state recommendations in the first paragraph. The remaining paragraphs should present the rationale for the recommendations, including expected consequences (both desirable and undesirable). Each case has a set of questions (found below), which are a _guide_ to help you with the analysis – however, you should not limit your analysis to narrowly answering these questions. A good report is not a chronology of analysis, but a clearly articulated statement of recommendation and support. If there are options under consideration in the case that you reject, a clear rationale for your decision should be provided. Facts stated in the case need not be restated unless used to make a point. Do not summarize the case in your paper.

Grading
-------

Write-ups will be graded with the following items considered:

*   Broad discussion of relevant strategic, operational and environmental issues.
*   Analysis
*   Qualitative analysis of all factors relevant to the problem.
*   Quantitative analysis (if appropriate) and explanation of approach.
*   Explicit recommendations, reasoning, and implications of such, including discussion of implementation and expected consequences of the recommendations.
*   Clarity, logic, creativity, exposition.
